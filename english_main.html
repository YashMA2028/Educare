Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action—
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

        <h3> Summary</h3>
        <span>
Shakespeare's "All the world's a stage" compares life to a play in which people are actors, passing through seven stages of life. These stages ar
1. Infancy - Helpless, crying in the nurse’s arms.
2. Childhood - A reluctant schoolboy, dragging himself to school.
3. Young love - A passionate, sighing lover writing poems for his beloved.
4. Soldier - A brash, honor-seeking soldier, eager for fame and quick to quarrel.
5. Middle age - A wise judge, with a formal appearance, offering advice.
6. Old age - A frail, thin old man, physically declining and becoming childlike.
7. Oblivion - The final stage, where a person loses all faculties and fades into nothingness.
            
The speech reflects the inevitability of aging and the transient nature of life.
