    <h3>Modern Historiography</h3>
    <b><p>Characteristics of historiography:</p></b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>It is a method based on scientific principles. It begins with the formation of relevant questions which are asked in logical order. Hence it is akin to scientific method </li>
        <li>These questions are anthropocentric which means they centre around the man and his activities in ancient societies.History doen not advocate any interraction between the Divine and human deeds </li>
        <li>Answers to these questions are based on reliable evidences and are presented in logical order</li>
        <li>History presnets a trajectory of man's journey with the help of his past deeds and actions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Development of scientific prespective in Europe and Historiography:</h3>
    <b><p>Development of scientific prespective</p></b>
    <p>Europe achieved remarkable progress till 18th century C.E in the fields of Philosophy and Science.
         Scholars belonging to one school of thought presented the idea of applying this knowledge of scientific method to
          study social and historical truths. After that discussions were focused on objectivity in history and historiography. 
          History gained importance over philosophical discourses and Divine phenomena. In 1737 CE, the Gottingen University was founded in Germany. 
          It had an independent department of history. Later, German universities became centres of historical studies. </p>
    <h3>Annales School:</h3>
    <p>At the dawn of tweentieth century, a new school of historiography arose in France known as '<b>Annales School</b>'. 
    An idea was put forth that history is not just about political events ,kings , great leaders, wars, politics and diplomacy.
    It is also about climate , local people, agriculture, trade, technology, means of communication, social divsions and their collective psychology, etc </p>

    <h3>Feminist Historiography</h3>
    <p>The restructing of the history from the perspective of women is called <b>Feminist historiography</b>. This thought was propounded by French feminist scholar Simone de Beauvoir.
    Feminist Historiography emphasised not only to include women in history but also to rethink on the male-dominated perspective of history.
    Later, many aspects of women's life became the focus of historical research such as their employment, their role in trade union, family life, etc.
    After 1990, women were portrayed as an independent class</p>

            <li>The class which owns the means of production exploits the rest of the classes.
